# Looting Mobs
## Slightly OP Minecraft Datapack allowing you to get every possible drop from a mob.

This project is my fourth go on a Minecraft Datapack, therefore not very good, nor efficient. This datapack forces mobs to drop all their possible drops at the max amount. That means always get 4 blaze rods, or 4 ender pearls, or that armor trim from the elder guardian. Everything drops.

This datapack has been tested and works in following versions:

* 1.21.4

## How to install this datapack
It's very simple! Just follow these instructions:
1. Download the LootingMobs.zip from releases.
2. Unzip the zipped folder.
3. Go to ".minecraft\saves\yourworld\datapacks" and drag the datapack in there. 
3. Alternatively, you can create a new world in-game, go to "More", click on "Data Packs" and drag the datapack in there.

The Datapack will begin as soon as you join the world, to disable/enable the datapack run:

* /datapack disable "file/Looting Mobs"
* /datapack enable "file/Looting Mobs"

## Found a bug?
You can do the one of the following:

* Submit an issue detailing what occured, how it occured and or if you modified the datapack in any way. 
* DM me on discord (username: meilaleinalainen).
* Try to fix it yourself. This datapack is poorly made so I wouldn't recommend this option.
